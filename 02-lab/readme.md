        <li>Write a program to check the given number is odd or even.</li>
        <li>Write a program to find maximum among two numbers.</li>
        <li>Write a program to check the given number is exactly divisible by 5 but not 7.</li>
        <li>Write a program to check the given year is leap year or not.</li>
        <li>Write a program to read a positive integer value and compute the following sequence. If the number is even, half it; if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1, then print the result. If input value is less than 1, print a message containing the word “ERROR”.</li>
        <li>Write a program to calculate the real roots of the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0. If the roots are imaginary, display the message “Error”.</li>
        <li>Write a program to read three sides of triangle and print area for valid data and to print “Invalid data” if either one side of the triangle is greater than or equal to the sum of other two sides.</li>
        <li>Write a program to find largest among three numbers. (use nested-if else)</li>

            Write a program to read a temperature of a day in Fahrenheit and print:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nice day</strong> if temperature is greater than 60 but less than 80.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold day</strong> if temperature is 60 or lower.</li>
                <li><strong>Hot day</strong> if temperature is 80 or higher.</li>

            An electricity board charges according to following rates:<br>
            For the first 20 units – Rs.80<br>
            For the next 80 units – Rs.7.5 per unit<br>
            For the next 100 units – Rs.8.5 per unit<br>
            For the beyond 200 units – Rs.9.5 per unit<br>
            Tax 15% in total amount is charged to all users.<br>
            Write a program to read number of units consumed and print out the total charge.

            Let's consider the supermarket discount policy: the policy offers a 5% discount on the total bill to all customers, irrespective of their purchase amount. Additionally, female customers receive a 10% discount if their total bill exceeds Rs. 5000. Write a C program to implement this discount policy and calculate the final bill after applying these discounts.
